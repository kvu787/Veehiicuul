# SimplePaint specification

This is the canonical contract for the SimplePaint module in this folder. It defines the real-number appearance, accepted machine inputs, finite-precision evaluation, geometry requirements, GPU layout, and verification criteria. The C++/HLSL sources implement this contract; the included tests verify it. [Usage.md](Usage.md) explains the controls and integration, and [README.md](README.md) identifies the module's entry points. The supported development and target platform is Windows 11 x64.

## Purpose and abstract interface

SimplePaint makes it easy to color 3D models in a way that looks good from any angle.

| Parameter   | Abstract domain  | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| R, G, B     | Each in (0, 1)   | Base color in user-facing sRGB space                        |
| Brightness  | (0, 1)           | Positions the base-color anchor on the tone curve           |
| Shift       | [0, 1)           | Warps the facing lobe in the direction selected by Rotation |
| Rotation    | [0, 360) degrees | Circular orientation of the shift                           |
| Dark Point  | [0, 1)           | Tone selected when the warped facing value is zero          |
| Light Point | (0, 1]           | Tone selected when the warped facing value is one           |

All parameters are finite. There is no ordering constraint on Dark Point and Light Point. Reversed ranges are valid; equal endpoints inside (0, 1) produce constant color. Rotation has a canonical interval: 360 degrees is rejected even though its direction is mathematically equivalent to zero.

The surface is opaque and unlit. The output is linear RGB, with alpha 1 in the supplied DX12 adapter. Paint depends only on the material and the oriented surface normal in the orthographic camera frame. It has no light, camera-position, perspective, texture, or distance inputs.

## Normals and the camera frame

The frame is right-handed view space: +X points right, +Y up, and +Z toward the camera. The input normal is rotated by **negative Rotation** about Z. Equivalently, the lobe direction rotates counterclockwise on screen as the user increases Rotation.

For the equations below, let `(x,y,z)` denote that rotated, unit-length normal. The implementation can use an unnormalized vector because its length cancels from the homogeneous expressions described later. It must still be finite and nonzero.

Projection is exclusively orthographic. The supplied VS computes clip XYZ with three four-component dot products and sets clip W to one. Normals interpolate with `noperspective`. Each triangle has one material, and its material index interpolates with `nointerpolation`. A constant material rotation is linear and commutes with interpolation, so it is applied in VS instead of PS.

## Real-number reference mathematics

All formulas in this section use exact real-number arithmetic. They define appearance independently of the finite-precision implementation.

### Decode the base color

For each user-facing sRGB channel `C`, decode the linear channel `c`:

```text
c = C / 12.92                         when C <= 0.04045
c = ((C + 0.055) / 1.055)^2.4        otherwise
```

All paint calculations use linear RGB. The host encodes the output to sRGB exactly once for display, for example through an sRGB render-target view.

### Warp the facing lobe

Let `s = Shift`:

```text
r = sqrt(x*x + z*z)
h = sqrt((1-s)*(1+s))

f = 0                              when z <= 0
f = r*z*h / (r-s*x)                 when z > 0
```

On the front hemisphere, `r > 0`, and `r-s*x >= (1-s)*r > 0`. Thus there is no singular denominator in this branch. The facing satisfies `0 < f <= r <= 1`.

An equivalent circular-slice construction applies a Schlick bias to the horizontal slice coordinate:

```text
sliceStart = -r
sliceEnd   =  r
u1 = (1+s)/2
u2 = (1-s)/2
v  = (x+r)/(2*r)
w  = u2*v / (u1*(1-v) + u2*v)       Schlick bias
X  = -r + 2*r*w
f  = sqrt(r*r-X*X)                  front hemisphere
```

The circular-slice and rational forms define the same facing lobe. For `s=0`, `f=z` on the front hemisphere. In the rotated frame the maximum is attained at `(s,0,h)`, where `f=1`. Rotation therefore selects the direction of the sideways shift. The facing-lobe and anchored color-curve mathematical construction is credited to Kevin Vu.

### Silhouette and back hemisphere

For every fixed `s < 1`, the front-facing formula approaches zero continuously as `z` approaches zero. The bound `f <= r` also handles the two Y-axis slice poles. Define the entire back hemisphere, including `z=0`, as `f=0`; evaluate that branch before any slice arithmetic.

There is no positive facing cutoff or configurable shader epsilon. Every front-facing normal uses the lobe formula, including arbitrarily small positive `z`. The stable evaluation below preserves small highlight complements without introducing a discontinuity.

The complete mathematical paint function is continuous in the normal, including the silhouette, for a fixed interior material. It is generally **not differentiable across the front/back boundary**, since the back hemisphere is constant. The core color curve is smooth; the complete shader must not be described as globally smooth.

### Remap tone and evaluate the color curve

Let `p = Brightness`, `d = Dark Point`, and `l = Light Point`. For each linear base-color channel `c`:

```text
t = d*(1-f) + l*f
A = c*p
B = (1-c)*(1-p)
F(t) = A*t / (A*t + B*(1-t))
```

`A` and `B` are strictly positive. The denominator is positive for the full closed tone interval [0,1]. This anchored Schlick curve has denominator `(c-(1-p))*t + (1-p)*(1-c)` when expanded.

```text
F(0)   = 0
F(1)   = 1
F(1-p) = c
F'(t)  = A*B / (A*t+B*(1-t))^2 > 0
```

The base color anchors the curve at tone `1-p`. Increasing Brightness moves that anchor toward zero; it does not multiply the output. Tone remapping preserves endpoint colors `F(d)` and `F(l)`, including inverted or constant ranges. Dark Point and Light Point are input tones, not displayed luminance values.

## Accepted machine inputs

The reference's open domains permit values arbitrarily close to singular corners in their closure. A fixed binary32 implementation needs a separate numerical contract. This implementation chooses the exactly representable margin `m = 2^-10 = 0.0009765625` and `M = 1-m = 0.9990234375`.

| Parameter   | Numerical domain |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| R, G, B     | Each in [m, M]   |
| Brightness  | [m, M]           |
| Shift       | [0, M]           |
| Rotation    | [0, 360) degrees |
| Dark Point  | [0, M]           |
| Light Point | [m, 1]           |

This is a deliberate supported subset of the abstract equations. The margin bounds both the lobe's concentration and the extreme color curves, gives simple identical UI limits, and meets the tested error criterion below. It is **not claimed to be the smallest possible margin**. The evaluation uses no positive-denominator floor. Narrow smooth highlights and finite image sampling are not used to justify these limits or to introduce filtering requirements.

The smallest linear base color is approximately `7.56e-5`; the smallest `A` is approximately `7.38e-8`. Merely using positive curve coefficients is insufficient: a rounded facing value near one can still erase the tiny quantity `1-f` and significantly alter such a curve. The implementation retains that quantity independently.

`Parameters` uses C++ `double`. `Material::Compile` checks every field, including finite status, **before conversion or coefficient computation**, and throws `std::invalid_argument` naming the offending parameter. Values just outside a limit must not round into the accepted interval. Negative zero is accepted where zero is allowed. Equal and reversed tone endpoints are accepted.

Serialization and user-interface parsing belong to the host. Validate parsed binary64 parameters before conversion to GPU constants; SimplePaint has no JSON dependency.

Coefficients, trig, square roots, and sRGB conversion are calculated in binary64 and then stored in binary32. This ordinary rounding is part of the implementation. Extremely small positive Shift or Dark Point can have a coefficient contribution below binary32 resolution, which does not imply a material-validation failure. Abstractly excluded endpoints are never admitted, and no requested input is clamped or angle wrapped.

## Stable GPU evaluation

### Homogeneous facing weights

Avoid computing `f` and then subtracting it from one. Instead construct nonnegative weights `(P,Q)` with `f=P/(P+Q)` and `1-f=Q/(P+Q)`. Let `(x,y,z)` now be the unnormalized, rotated normal and `L` its length.

For `z<=0`, use `(P,Q)=(0,1)`. For exact zero Shift on the front hemisphere:

```text
L = sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z)
P = z
Q = (x*x+y*y)/(L+z)
```

Since `Q=L-z`, this is the same facing ratio, with a stable complement at the maximum. No normal normalization or rotation is needed on the zero-shift path.

For nonzero Shift, the CPU supplies `k = sqrt((1-s)/(1+s))`. Scale the XZ slice before squaring to avoid underflow near the Y poles:

```text
v = max(abs(x), z)                  positive because z>0
X = x/v
Z = z/v
R = sqrt(X*X+Z*Z)
r = v*R

a = k*(R+X), b = Z                when x>=0
a = k*Z,     b = R-X              when x<0

S = a*a+b*b
P = r*(2*a*b)
Q = (y*y/(L+r))*S + r*(a-b)*(a-b)
```

The two half-angle charts describe the same warped circle, using `R+abs(X)` rather than a cancellation-prone subtraction. In either chart its facing within the slice is `2ab/S`. Also:

```text
P+Q = (L-r)*S + r*((a-b)^2+2ab) = L*S
P/(P+Q) = (r/L)*(2ab/S)
```

These weights evaluate the specified shifted Schlick lobe. `Q` uses `L-r = y*y/(L+r)` and `S-2ab = (a-b)^2`, keeping both contributions nonnegative. Scaling the slice leaves `a,b` well conditioned even when the slice radius is tiny. This preserves the intended peak and avoids a denominator epsilon.

### Compose tone and color once on the CPU

For each color channel calculate:

```text
ND = A*d             NL = A*l
CD = B*(1-d)         CL = B*(1-l)
scale = max(ND,NL,CD,CL)
```

Divide all four coefficients by `scale` before storing them. Their common scale cancels from the result; at least one stored coefficient per channel is exactly one. `NL` and `CD` stay strictly positive and comfortably normal within the accepted material ranges. `ND` and `CL` may be zero at allowed tone endpoints. Contributions that underflow from negligible tiny positive inputs do not remove denominator positivity.

The pixel shader evaluates:

```text
numerator  = ND*Q + NL*P
complement = CD*Q + CL*P
color = numerator/(numerator+complement)
```

Substitution of `t=d*(1-f)+l*f` proves equivalence to `F(t)`. No division is needed to recover facing, and no per-pixel tone interpolation is needed. There is no subtraction of nearly equal color denominator terms and no positive-denominator floor.

Final RGB saturation removes binary32 output overshoot only: reciprocal multiplication can produce a result slightly above one. It does not clamp material inputs or alter the real-number denominator. The core returns RGB in [0,1], independently of the host's render-target format.

Use full `float` arithmetic, not `half`/`min16float`. Direct3D's [floating-point rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/floating-point-rules) permit flushing denormal inputs/results; the core does not rely on denormal preservation. The slice chart and the validated normal magnitude avoid a zero denominator; vanishing geometric contributions can round to zero without creating a finite cutoff parameter. DXC's [denormal-mode documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Denorm-Mode) describes optional control in later shader models; this implementation targets SM 6.0 and does not require it.

## Geometry and transform validation

`SimplePaint::ValidateMesh` runs before upload. It checks nonempty indexed triangle data, index bounds, finite bounded positions, normal lengths in [0.5,2], valid material indices, and one material per triangle. Position components must have magnitude at most one million. Indices are unsigned 32-bit values in the reusable validator.

For each triangle, let `S` be the sum of its three vertex normals. Each vertex normal must satisfy `dot(N,S) >= 0.125*length(S)`, with `S` nonzero. Thus every barycentric interpolation has projection at least 0.125 on the same unit direction. Its length cannot approach zero. This is a conservative sufficient condition: some mathematically usable meshes are rejected so the GPU core can rely on a simple validated contract. Normal validation does not repair data or flip normals. Degenerate positional triangles need not shade any pixels; winding and culling are application choices.

`Orthographic::MakeProjection` validates finite width/height in [1e-4,1e6], `0<=near<far<=1e6`, and a depth span of at least 1e-4. `BuildObjectTransforms` validates its packed projection, finite matrix entries of magnitude at most 1e6, affine W entries `(0,0,0,1)`, orthogonal basis vectors, and uniform scale in [1/1024,1024]. Relative tolerance 1e-5 permits floating-point rotation-matrix roundoff; it is not support for artistic shear/nonuniform scaling.

Combined with the mesh cone condition, these transforms keep interpolated normal lengths approximately between 1/8192 and 2048. Squared full lengths are far from binary32 underflow and overflow. XZ slices can still be arbitrarily small, which is why the shifted evaluation scales them separately. A host using different geometry or transform routines must enforce equivalent conditions before invoking the core. The reusable shader cannot validate corrupted GPU buffers or unvalidated host data.

## Encapsulation, layout, and DX12 integration

This folder is the complete copyable module, with its own CMake target and integration README. `Material.*` owns parameters, validation, sRGB conversion, coefficient construction, and the GPU ABI. It is a C++20 library independent of DirectX types and scene settings. `Geometry.h` owns reusable mesh validation. `OrthographicTransforms.h` owns the optional DirectXMath transform adapter. `SimplePaintCore.hlsli` owns rotation, facing, and color evaluation and declares no bindings or material counts. `SimplePaint.hlsl` provides a reusable DX12 adapter whose `SIMPLE_PAINT_MATERIAL_COUNT` defaults to one; the host configures the count for both stages. Serialization, GPU resources, and synchronization belong to the host.

| Byte offset | C++ / HLSL field | Meaning                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0           | warp             | cos(-angle), sin(-angle), k, nonzero flag |
| 16          | numeratorDark    | ND for RGB, zero padding                  |
| 32          | numeratorLight   | NL for RGB, zero padding                  |
| 48          | complementDark   | CD for RGB, zero padding                  |
| 64          | complementLight  | CL for RGB, zero padding                  |

C++ asserts size 80, alignment 16, trivial copyability, and every field offset. The GPU tests exercise all six material indices, so the constant-buffer array stride and bindings are tested with the production shaders. `Material` has no mutating setters; `Compile` returns a complete material only after all validation succeeds. `Constants()` exposes read-only owned data for copying to an upload buffer.

The supplied DX12 adapter binds a 96-byte `Orthographic::ObjectTransforms` block at `b0` and a tightly packed `GpuMaterial` array at `b1`. Each constant-buffer start address is 256-byte aligned, and CBV allocation sizes are rounded up to a multiple of 256 bytes. Material array elements retain their 80-byte stride. For example, six materials occupy 480 bytes in a 512-byte allocation. The host must match the compiled material count in both shader stages and its C++ allocation, then synchronize any updates against GPU use.

## Optimization

The implementation precomputes sRGB conversion, angle trig, shift square root, curve coefficients, tone remapping, and per-channel coefficient scaling. The shader loads five float4 material registers. The orthographic adapter omits view-vector construction, perspective correction, and normal normalization. Material rotation runs per vertex. Exact zero Shift selects a smaller path independently of Rotation.

The PS source has one square root on the zero-shift path and two on the shifted path. It has no pow, log, exponent, sine, cosine, or normal rsqrt. The GPU tests compile the supplied shaders with DXC `-O3 -Ges -WX`. The shifted slice arithmetic protects near-pole and near-peak behavior. Optimizations must preserve the numerical contract; inspect optimized DXIL and rerun correctness checks after changing the arithmetic or compiler settings.

## Verification

Run the module's five CTest entries using [the standalone build commands](Usage.md#build-and-verify):

| Test                   | Coverage                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SimplePaintContract    | 81,940 curve samples; anchors, endpoints, monotonicity, and parameter validation |
|                        | 20,000 independent slice/Schlick versus rational facing comparisons              |
|                        | Adjacent binary64 bounds, NaN, infinities, and invalid transforms                |
| OrthographicTransforms | 4,000 packed transform comparisons and near/far depth endpoints                  |
| SimplePaintGpuHardware | 30,208 production VS/PS samples on the preferred hardware adapter                |
| SimplePaintGpuWarp     | The same 30,208 samples on WARP                                                  |
| SimplePaintStandalone  | Fresh copied consumer, public C++ interfaces, shader counts, and copied tests    |

`SimplePaintStandalone` copies the module's source, documentation, and tests into a fresh consumer project. It builds and runs every public C++ interface using consumer-owned geometry, compiles VS/PS with the default material count of one and an explicit count of three, and checks that zero is rejected. It also builds and runs the copied module's full CPU/GPU suite, excluding the recursive copy check. No host application sources or build scripts are required.

The independent binary64 GPU reference in `Tests/SimplePaintReference.h` starts from the requested binary64 material parameters and the stored binary32 interpolated normal. It evaluates the specification's rotation, normalized rational facing, explicit tone remapping, and uncomposed color curve. This includes CPU coefficient conversion, VS rotation, GPU interpolation, and shader evaluation error. It does not measure errors from an external mesh exporter or an arbitrary host's world/view calculation; `OrthographicTransforms` covers the supplied transform adapter separately.

The regression acceptance criterion is finite output in [0,1], alpha exactly one, and **maximum absolute per-channel error <= 0.001 in both linear RGB and sRGB** on both GPU backends. The sRGB criterion is measured before display quantization. Each GPU run includes 4,096 cases with distinct triangle vertex normals and fails on DX12 debug-layer warnings or errors when the debug layer is available. The test prints the measured maximum errors and whether debug validation was available.

The deterministic suite covers boundaries, peaks, poles, both sides of the silhouette, inverted and constant tone ranges, scaled normals, interpolation, and random cases. It is not an exhaustive proof over all binary64 parameter combinations or a promise of bitwise identity across GPU drivers. The abstract equivalence and positive-denominator arguments are analytic; the finite-precision error criterion is tested. Rerun the GPU tests when changing the compiler, arithmetic, accepted limits, or target hardware. Host applications must additionally test their own mesh validation and rendering integration.

An optional GPU-timestamp microbenchmark is available as `BuildOutput/Tests/SimplePaintGpuTests.exe --benchmark` after the standalone Ninja build described in Usage.md. It times 128 warmed 1024x1024 draws for Shift=0 and Shift=0.6, using constant normals and a float4 render target. It excludes CPU submission, setup, and readback; its output is not a whole-scene FPS prediction.
